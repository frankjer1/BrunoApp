# Bruno

Bruno is an app which let the user find a petsitter nearby. It can also used from petsitters to find new customers.
The app is still a project under construction, just few things are actually implemented.

## How it works

The app displays the petsitters in two different ways:
- Throught a **List**, that for each petsitter displays the rating, the distance, the image, the name and the pets. All the elemets can be filtered.
- Throught a **Map**, that displays the petsitters nearby your current localisation.
Each petsitter has a **personal page**, accessible from both the modalities by just clicking on the petsitter itself.
